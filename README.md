The challenges I faced: I got an error at my first attempt to push my work to my repo. 
I overcame this challenge because I realised by the help of my instructor that I was trying to push to another repo which is not mine and I don't have permission to do that, so I created my own repo and did all the necessary things and pushed to it.

This project was done and submitted for approval by:
